# Analystt.ai

In this project I have created a page which fetches company's data from the backend api. <br>
I have added the comments on the code to better understandability. <br>
For styling I have used react-bootstrap.

### This project is made using (MERN stack) MongoDB, ExpressJs, ReactJS & NodeJS.
### API used - https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/users
### use this route to get the data in the backend server- http://localhost:5000/api/data
### use this route to get the data in the frontend- http://localhost:3000/api/data 

### Features-
User will able to see the details of the company <br>
It has search functionality which enables user to search a specific company <br>
It has the feature of pagination which decreases the load of the api. <br>
On clicking on the details button user will able to see the complete detail of each company. <br>
It's UI is mobile and tablet friendly <br>
I have used error handling while fetching and displaying the data of api <br>
When there will be no data to show it shows message "No rows to show"
